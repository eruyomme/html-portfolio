<h1>The Best Movies According to Daiyu</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Annihilation</h3>
<p>This one became an instant classic to me. I actually didn't know the term "cosmic horror" until this movie. 
  I love the weird feeling it gives me.</p>

<h3>Pan's Labyrinth</h3>
<p>A childhood favourite. Loved it then, love it now, gonna love it forever. I am glad I watched it as a child 
  because I used to be such a scaredy cat but once I saw Ophelia being so brave (and I was roughly the same 
  age as her), I decided that I, too, could face  my fears. Beautiful folk story, stunning  photography, left 
  its mark on me forever.</p>

<h3>Midsommar</h3>
<p>This is one is relatively new. I'm really obsessed with everything about it... The nature cult, the fact 
  that it never truly gets dark (so you can see the characters getting worn out of this kind of scenery as the 
  days pass by), Dani's crazy resolution, the use of psychedelics, the VISUAL EFFECTS of psychedelics. Yeah, I 
  could ramble about it for days if you allow me too.</p>
